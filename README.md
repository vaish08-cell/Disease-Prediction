# diases-prediction
🏥 Disease Prediction System 📌 Overview This is a machine learning-based disease prediction system that predicts whether a person has diabetes, heart disease, or Parkinson’s disease based on user input. The system is built using Streamlit for the frontend and ML models for prediction.

🛠️ Technologies Used Python 🐍 Streamlit (for UI) Scikit-learn (for model training) Pandas & NumPy (for data processing) Pickle (for model storage) ⚡ Features ✔ Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease ✔ User-friendly Streamlit interface ✔ Models trained on real-world datasets ✔ Fast and accurate results

🚀 How to Run 1️⃣ Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Akshitha-Mothkur/disease-prediction cd disease-prediction

2️⃣ Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Run the application: streamlit run web.py

4️⃣ Enter the required details and get predictions!

📊 How It Works User inputs health parameters Pre-trained ML models process the data Prediction is displayed on the UI
